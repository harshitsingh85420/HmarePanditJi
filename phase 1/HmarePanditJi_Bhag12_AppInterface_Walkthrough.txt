BHAG 12 — APP INTERFACE & REGISTRATION FLOW
Ek Detailed Walkthrough — Customer App, Pandit App & Key Platform Principles
This document is the standalone extraction of Bhag 12 from the HmarePanditJi Complete Business Idea Documentation. It provides a screen-by-screen walkthrough of exactly how users will experience the platform — from first download through to post-booking management. This is the source of truth for UI/UX decisions, feature specifications, and the 8 platform non-negotiables.
8 NON-NEGOTIABLE PLATFORM PRINCIPLES (From Bhag 12)
1.  Progressive Permissions — Location immediately optional, Contacts only during booking flow
2.  Interactive Tutorial System — Skippable, replayable via help button on both apps
3.  Muhurat Explorer — Dedicated calendar on home showing auspicious dates & puja counts
4.  Muhurat Confirmation Session — Optional Rs.499 expert consultation before final payment
5.  Dual Samagri Paths — Pandit's Fixed Package (non-negotiable) OR Platform Custom List
6.  Food Allowance System — Rs.1,000/day for travel days + puja days (meals not provided)
7.  Travel is Preferential — Pandit sets modes & distance ranges; platform handles all logistics
8.  Pandit Device Information — Auto-detected & displayed on public profile as tech-readiness signal
PART I — Customer App Experience
The customer experience is built around one principle: explore everything without barriers, commit only when ready to book.
1.1  Download & Initial Experience (No Registration Required)
First Open
User downloads 'HmarePanditJi' from Play Store / App Store.
App opens with full-screen language selection:
'Continue in English'  |  'Hindi mein jaari rakhein'
Language sets entire app UI — all text, voice prompts, and notifications follow this choice.
Interactive App Tutorial (Skippable)
Immediately after language selection, a welcome tutorial begins. Never shown again unless the user explicitly replays it.
Screen 1: 'Explore all pujas without registration'
Screen 2: 'Check muhurat dates instantly on Muhurat Explorer'
Screen 3: 'Book with verified Pandits from Delhi-NCR and nationwide'
Screen 4: 'Manage travel, food, samagri — all in one place'
Screen 5: 'Guest Mode — no need to register until you book!'
Each screen: [Next] + prominent [Skip Tutorial] buttons. Last screen leads to Home Dashboard.
Tutorial Replay: Persistent '?' help icon in top-right corner on every screen.
Permission Requests — Progressive & Contextual
DESIGN PRINCIPLE: Never ask for permissions upfront — earn them through context
Location: Requested immediately but optional — clear visible benefit (nearby pandits + muhurat accuracy)
Contacts: Requested ONLY when 'Add family members' tapped inside booking flow Step 2
Camera: Requested ONLY when Pandit initiates video KYC during onboarding
Location Permission (Immediate, Optional)
Dialog: 'Allow location access to find Pandits near you and auto-fill your address for accurate muhurat calculations?'
If ALLOWED: Auto-detects city + locality. User confirms/edits with map pin. Option to save as Primary Address.
If DENIED: Home dashboard loads normally. No features blocked. User can set city manually.
Contacts Permission (Delayed — Only During Booking)
Never shown at launch.
Only appears in Booking Step 2 (Event Details) when user taps 'Add family members'.
Fully optional — user can type names manually.
1.2  Guest Mode — Explore Without Registration
The entire app is accessible without registration in Guest Mode. A persistent 'Exploring as Guest' badge appears in the header. Registration triggers only at first booking attempt.
Full capabilities in Guest Mode:
Browse Home Dashboard — search bar, quick category pills, featured Pandits
Use Muhurat Explorer calendar — tap any date to see puja types + available muhurat windows
View all puja categories and browse the full Pandit directory
Search Pandits nationwide with full filters (date, budget, travel mode, language, distance)
View complete Pandit profiles: photos, verified badges, device info, audio bio, reviews, pricing, samagri packages
Run travel cost calculator — enter origin/destination for cost estimates
Build custom samagri list with live platform pricing
View full price breakdowns: dakshina + samagri + travel + food allowance + fees + GST
REGISTRATION TRIGGER
Registration begins ONLY when user taps 'Check Availability & Book' or 'Proceed to Pay'.
All real prices are shown in guest mode — no bait-and-switch at any point.
'Exploring as Guest' badge disappears once the user is logged in.
1.3  Registration Flow — Phone OTP
Step A — Phone Verification
User enters 10-digit mobile number. Taps [Send OTP].
6-digit OTP received via SMS. Auto-filled on supported devices.
30-second countdown before [Resend OTP] becomes available.
On correct OTP: system checks if phone is new or existing.
Step B — Role & Name (New Users Only)
Existing phone → auto-detected as Customer or Pandit, routed accordingly. No extra step.
New Customer → 'What should we call you?' name field → [Get Started]
New Pandit → name field + note: 'After login, complete your profile to start receiving bookings (~10 mins).'
Post-Login Redirect Logic
New Customer → Home Dashboard (/) with welcome toast
Returning Customer → Home or [next] param (e.g., back to booking flow where left off)
New Pandit → Pandit Onboarding Wizard (/onboarding)
Returning Pandit (pending verification) → Dashboard with verification status card
Admin → Admin Operations Center
