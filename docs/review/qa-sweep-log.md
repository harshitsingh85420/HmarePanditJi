# QA SWEEP LOG — full-app driven walk (qa/harsh-pass)

**Founder's explicit priority.** Drive the browser, find every error (UI counts as
much as logic), fix immediately, one commit per fix, gates green after each. NO
MERGE — Isj reviews per batch.

## Setup
- Branch: `fix/qa-sweep` off main (base SHA `0ab7a67`).
- LOCAL dev server (pandit) on :3002 — NOT the preview.
- Mobile emulation **390px width** (founder's directive for this campaign;
  supersedes the 360×740 note in the mobile-only-qa memory for this run).
- Login: `9876500050` / OTP `123456` (works on main).
- Both logged-out and logged-in states where a route has both.

## Per-screen loop
Load → screenshot@390 → FUNCTION → UI (vs canon + floors: label≥15, body≥18,
tap≥52, AAA) → LANGUAGE (register law) → TRUTHFUL-STATE → CONSOLE (zero err/warn)
→ FIX → log PASS/FIXED/FLAGGED.

## DO NOT fix unilaterally — FLAG (money/refund/payout/fee · auth/session/identity/
Aadhaar · DLT template text · anything contradicting CONFLICT_RULINGS · any fix
that would weaken a guard). Flag with screen + problem + proposed fix, keep walking.

## RESUME POINTER
> **Next:** CONTINUE the स्थान walk (voice-fired check via the voicedebug badge
> [dark circle, count visible bottom-right]; अनुमति दीजिए → geolocation grant AND
> deny paths; शहर खुद चुनिए → manual-city screen) → भाषा → परिचय[4 mic outcomes,
> re-verify the persistent skip] → पंजीकरण → OTP → tutorial. Then authenticated B2.
> Fresh-install state reached by localStorage.clear() + reload.
> Env: qa/harsh-pass · dev server :3002 against LIVE API · 390×844 · seed tab.
> Voice checks: शिष्य must be AWAKE (orb 💤 = muted persisted → silence is by
> design, wake first); speechSynthesis fallback makes NO network request, so
> "tts fired" = /api/v1/ai/sarvam/tts in network OR voicedebug panel evidence
> (?voicedebug=1), never network-absence alone.

## B1 — PANDIT ONBOARDING (splash · प्रतीक्षा · भाषा · स्थान[both] · परिचय · पंजीकरण · OTP · tutorial)
> परिचय: test all FOUR mic outcomes explicitly (granted/denied/dismissed/unavailable).
> Note: परिचय dead-end for dismissed already FIXED on main (a88b34d, persistent
> "बिना आवाज़ के आगे बढ़िए") — re-verify it holds here.

| Screen | State | Result | What | SHA |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| स्थान (location perm) | fresh-install | **FIXED(1) — walk in progress** | सुला दें pill wrapped mid-phrase ("सुला/दें" stacked under the icon, squeezed to 84px by the orb column) → whitespace-nowrap + w-max on ShishyaMuteControl; verified on-screen 96×52 one-line. Ruling-#9 orb VERIFIED LIVE in dev (awake orb + सुला दें present). CTAs measured: अनुमति दीजिए 21px/62h ✓, शहर-खुद 17px/52h ✓. Voice/canon/function checks continue next session. | (qa branch) |
| /login (phone entry) | logged-out, resumed-state | **PASS (floors/function/register)** + 1 FLAG | Floors measured & PASS: labels 15px (orb-label, field-label), body/cta 20-21px, taps 56-66px (input 56, CTAs 62, orb 66). Register clean ("ट्यूटोरियल फिर देखिए" — the suspected typo was a screenshot font artifact; DOM verified). Truthful copy ("खाता होगा तो लॉगिन, नहीं तो नया बनेगा"). Console: dev-only webpack asset-size warnings (not app defects; bundle sizes ARE a perf flag — main-app 10.7MiB dev). Orb wake-tap works (💤 → awake). | — |

### Console errors (B1)
- None (app-level). Dev-only: webpack asset-size warnings (main-app 10.7 MiB dev bundle — perf note, not a defect gate for dev mode).

### Flagged for Isj (B1)
0. ~~RESOLVED (founder GO)~~ — Ruling #9 cherry-picked to main (9db3326) +
   68b5fcb/404005a picked (35a393a), all deploy-VERIFIED via /version; tutorial
   branch rebased onto main (drift closed, 11 tutorial-only commits remain,
   gate wall green: tsc×4, 38 api guards, 772/772 pandit). **audio-check.md
   BUNDLING (founder):** when delivered, it must include a named
   "mic-permission walk" section (granted/denied/dismissed/no-hardware) so Isj
   clears the MicPracticeArtboard real-device gate AND the audio pass in one
   sitting.
1. **~~RULING #9 IS STRANDED ON THE UNMERGED TUTORIAL BRANCH~~** (resolved above). Main's
   `ShishyaOrb.tsx` has NO `muteControl` / `ShishyaMuteControl` — the awake orb
   on /login shows no "सुला दें", and a second tap will SILENT-MUTE (the exact
   elder-hostile behavior Ruling #9 killed). The approved implementation +
   guards exist only on `feat/tutorial-system`, which is merge-gated on the
   artboard port. **Decision needed: cherry-pick the orb-gesture commits
   (4199421, a3ed720, + guards) onto main now, or accept old orb behavior until
   the tutorial branch merges.** Recommendation: cherry-pick — the ruling was
   approved independently of the artboards, and every live screen carries the
   orb. (Not fixed unilaterally: voice/gesture behavior + guarded component.)
2. **Voice-fired verification needs the debug panel**, not the network tab
   alone: the controller falls back to browser speechSynthesis (zero network).
   Wake-tap produced no observable TTS network call AND no speechSynthesis
   activity seconds later — INCONCLUSIVE; next session re-checks with
   ?voicedebug=1 before reporting a silence defect on /login.
